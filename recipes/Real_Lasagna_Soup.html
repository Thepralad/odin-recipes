        <h1>Real Lasagna Soup</h1>
        <p>
            This incredible lasagna soup tastes exactly like a really good lasagna, 
            but is a very rich, very meaty tomato soup. The little bit of <br> extra work 
            you'll do—precooking the noodles, then baking them in the oven—is absolutely 
            worth the time and effort. The buttery, <br> baked, and toasted noodles that are then
            added to the soup make this absolutely phenomenal.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you love lasagna, but don’t love the time and effort it takes to do all that 
            layering, then this amazing lasagna soup is for you.<br> Unlike many of the other lasagna 
            soup recipes online, this is way more than just some pasta, meat, and cheese sitting in
             a bowl <br> of thinned out tomato sauce. This is real lasagna in soup form. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Anyway, I loved how this came out, and I think one of the secrets is baking the pasta to 
            give it more of the taste and texture of an <br>actual baked lasagna noodle. They may not have
            looked much different in the final product, but I found the texture to be far superior <br>  to the
            standard technique, which is just to heat up some cooked pasta in the finished soup. So I do 
            recommend the extra few minutes <br>  of prep, but either way, if you’re in the mood for lasagna, but
            aren’t into the whole production, I really do hope you give this a try soon.<br>  Enjoy!

            <li>1/4 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>1 (24 ounce) jar prepared marinara sauce, or 3 cups homemade marinara sauce</li>
            <li>4 cups chicken broth</li>
            <li>2 1/2 cups water</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Cheese Mixture</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>12 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>3 ounces mozzarella cheese, shredded</li>
            <li>1/2 cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><h3>Step 1</h3></li>
            <p>
                Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in lasagna noodles
                and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered,<br> stirring occasionally, until just flexible, 4 to 5 
                minutes. Transfer noodles into cold water until cooled; drain very well.
            </p>
            <li><h3>Step 2</h3></li>
            <p>
                Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper, 
                and grease parchment with 1 tablespoon olive oil.
            </p>
            <li><h3>Step 3</h3></li>
            <p>
                Cut noodles in half lengthwise. Arrange noodles in evenly overlapping rows on the prepared baking
                sheet. Brush with melted butter, and use <br> fingers to rub some butter between the noodles
            </p>
            <li><h3>Step 4</h3></li>
            <p>
                Bake noodles in the preheated oven until they are golden, blistered, and are beginning to brown 
                with crispy outside edges. Let cool; cut <br>into bite-sized pieces.
            </p>
            <li><h3>Step 5</h3></li>
            <p>
                Add 2 tablespoons olive oil to a soup pot, and place over high heat. Add beef and sausage. Use 
                a spatula to break up the meat into small pieces;<br> cook without stirring until liquid evaporates 
                and meat begins to sizzle in its own fat, then continue to cook and stir until meat begins to brown,
                 <br>about 7 minutes.
            </p>
            <li><h3>Step 6</h3></li>
            <p>
                Add onions, garlic, tomato paste, red pepper flakes, dried oregano, black pepper, and kosher salt. 
                Cook and stir until onions begin to turn <br>translucent, 3 to 4 minutes.
            </p>
            <li><h3>Step 7</h3></li>
            <p>
                In a bowl, stir ricotta cheese, mozzarella cheese, and Parmesan cheese together; set aside.
