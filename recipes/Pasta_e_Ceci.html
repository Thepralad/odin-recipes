            Pasta e Ceci (Italian Chickpea and Pasta Stew)
        </h1>
        <p>
            Pasta e Ceci, or Italian chickpea and pasta stew, is an Italian classic, and the star in my favorite Italian movie, "I Soliti Sospetti",<br>
            where the Usual Suspects try to steal money from a bank vault, but instead break into the wrong building and end up eating pasta <br> with chickpeas 
            in someone's kitchen. This is Italian comfort food. If you can't find ditalini pasta, use spaghetti that have been broken <br>into pieces.

            <li>1 stalk celery</li>
            <li>1 small zucchini</li>
            <li>1 carrot</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 sprig fresh sage leaves</li>
            <li>1 sprig fresh rosemary</li>
            <li>1 sprig fresh thyme</li>
            <li>3 cups chicken broth, or more as needed</li>
            <li>2 peeled whole canned tomatoes</li>
            <li>8 1/2 ounces ditalini pasta, such as Barilla® Gluten Free Ditalini</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 fresh cayenne pepper, seeded and minced, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><h3>Step 1</h3></li>
            <p> Rinse chickpeas under cool water. Pick up handfuls of chickpeas and
                rub them together with your hands under the water to <br> wash chickpeas. 
                Place chickpeas in a large stew pot, cover with water and add baking soda;
                swirl chickpeas and water to <br>distribute baking soda. Leave to soak for 8 hours
                or overnight.
            </p>
            <li><h3>Step 2</h3></li>
            <p> 
                The next day, pour chickpeas through a strainer and rinse well under cold 
                running water,eliminating any skins or discolored <br> chickpeas; set aside.
            </p>
            <li><h3>Step 3</h3></li>
            <p> 
                Grate onion, celery, zucchini, and carrot on the large teeth of a cheese grater,
                This step is very important as grated vegetables  <br>give a different flavor than diced. 
            </p>
            <li><h3>Step 4</h3></li>
            <p> 
                Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in the stew pot over medium heat, and sauté grated vegetables
                for 1 minute. Mix in sage, rosemary, <br> and thyme and sauté, stirring occasionally, until onions 
                are soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.
            </p>
            <li><h3>Step 5</h3></li>
            <p> 
                Add 3 cups broth, all the chickpeas, and tomatoes. Bring to a boil, reduce heat,
                and simmer until chickpeas are tender, about <br> 1 hour. Stir in pasta. Add more broth 
                only as needed to achieve a thick, stew-like consistency.
            </p>
            <li><h3>Step 6</h3></li>
            <p> 
                Cook until pasta is tender with a bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Taste and season with salt 
                and black pepper. Remove from heat and divide <br> amongst serving bowls. Top each bowl with
                minced cayenne pepper and a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil.
